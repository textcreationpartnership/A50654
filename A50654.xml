         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                           <p>There are only two ſorts of Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, of whoſe Office this Treatiſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth particular mention, and that is High Conſtables of Hundreds, and Petty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables in Towns and Pariſhes.</p>
                           <p>Now by the opinion of ſothe men, theſe High Conſtables were firſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to be choſen by the Statute of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and they were to make view of Armour twice every year, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent before the Juſtices aſſigned defaults of Armour, Watches, High-ways, Hue and Cry; and alſo ſuch as lodged Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers for whom they would not anſwer. <hi>Lamb. 5. Raſt all 379. C. D. 13. E. 1. C. 6. Dalton's J. P. Ch. 16. fol.</hi> 46.</p>
                           <p>And that the Petty Conſtables in Towns and Pariſhes, were after deviſed for the aid of the High Conſtables of Hundreds, about the beginning of the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third. <hi>Lamb. Duty Conſt. pag.</hi> 9.</p>
                           <p>But others are of opinion, that the High Conſtables were Conſervators of the Peace within their ſeveral Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds and Limits, by the ancient Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law. <hi>Crompt. 6. &amp; 222. 12. H. 7. fol.</hi> 18.</p>

                              <pb n="3" facs="tcp:102982:8"/>And that whereas the Sheriffs of Counties at the firſt had the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Counties committed to them, that afterwards by reaſon of the multitude of people, it being then too great a task for one man to undertake, thereupon Hundreds were deduced and derived out of the Counties, and in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them was ordained a Conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator of the Peace, who was called the High Conſtable; and after this Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs or Towns were made, and within every one of them alſo was ordained a Conſervator of the Peace, who is called the Petty Conſtable: and this was long before the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, as appears by the derivation of the words, and that they were in the time of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> ſo that it may ſeem as well the High Conſtables, as the Petty Conſtables and their Authorities, were by the Common Law; and that the old Statutes concerning them, are but a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital of the ancient Common Law, 12. <hi>H. 7. fol. 18. a. Dalton's J. P. Chap. 16. fol.</hi> 46.</p>
                           <p>Now there be other Officers of much like Authority to the Conſtables, as the Burſholders in <hi>Kent,</hi> the third Burrough
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102982:9"/>
in <hi>Warwickshire,</hi> and the Tythingman, Burroughhead, or Headburrough or Chief Pledge in other places; but yet the Office of a Conſtable is diſtinct and (as it ſeemeth) is of greater Authority than theſe other: for it is held by ſome that theſe Burſholders, Thirdburroughs, Tythingmen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being in a Town or Pariſh where a Conſtable is, that in ſuch caſe they cannot meddle, becauſe the Conſtables be (in compariſon of them) Head Officers, and that the others are but as Aſſiſtants to the Conſtables in all Services of his Office when the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is preſent, and in his abſence then theſe others are to attend the ſervice; and that there are many other things which the Conſtables may do, and wherewith the Burſholders and the reſt cannot meddle at all; and yet in Towns where there be no Conſtables, and that the Barſholders, Tythingmen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be there the only Officers for the Peace, as alſo in ſuch caſe where the Power or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Burſholder, Tythingman, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is declared to be equal with the power of the Conſtable, in all ſuch caſes and things, their Office and Authority be in a manner all one.

                           <p>Note that theſe Officers are to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant to Court Leets, Juſtices of the Peace, and Coroners, for the executing of their Warrants, within their ſeveral Precincts.</p>
                           <p>And now as to the choyce of theſe Conſtables, you ſhall underſtand that the Law requireth that every Conſtable be <hi>Idoneus homo,</hi> that is apt and fit for the execution of the ſaid Office, and he is ſaid in Law to be <hi>Idoneus,</hi> who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with theſe three things, honeſty, knowledge, and Ability. <hi>Co. 8.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102982:10"/>
he may attend and execute his Office di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, and not, through impotency of body or want, to neglect the place; for Conſtables choſen out of the meaner <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Lib. Rep. fol.</hi> 41.</p>
                           <p>And if any one ſhall be choſen Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, which is not thus qualified and inabled, he may by Law be diſcharged of his ſaid office, and another fit man may be appointed in his place. <hi>Co. 8. Lib. Rep. fol.</hi> 42.</p>
                           <p>Clergy-men, Juſtices of the Peace, Lawyers, Phyſicians, Attorneys, Women whether Maids, or Widows, Mad-men, Infants, old, ſick, decrepid perſons, nor poor people, are not to be choſen to the office of Conſtable.</p>
                           <p>And note, that a man is to ſerve this Office in reſpect of his perſonal abode and place of Reſiancy, and not in reſpect of his Land in another place, for if he have Lands in one place, and keep houſe

in another place, he muſt ſerve where he lives, and not where his Lands lie.</p>
                           <p>A cuſtom in a Pariſh or Town, that the Office of Conſtable ſhall go by the houſe is not good; for if a woman have an houſe there, ſhe is eligible, which is againſt Law; but a cuſtom that every man, ſufficient in the place, ſhall ſerve the office himſelf, or find a ſufficient man to ſerve it, may be good. <hi>Cro. 1.

                           <p>A Leet chooſing unable or unfit Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables is cauſe of forfeiture of the Leet, and ſuch choyce is void; and two Juſtices of Peace, upon complaint to them made, may remove ſuch a Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and chooſe and ſwear a new one. <hi>Dalt.

Raign of King <hi>Lucius,</hi> about the year of our Lord 180. but how long after it was before theſe Officers called Churchwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens were appointed, it cannot certainly be known; but Mr. <hi>Lambert</hi> and other Authors do agree, that they are very antient Officers, and by the antient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law they were, and are ſtill to take care, ſee to, and preſerve the Goods of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> the Church Books, Communion Cups, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and other decent Ornaments and furniture of the Church, which they do find there at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Office.</p>
                           <p>2. As to the choyce of theſe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers it is appointed by the Book of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, printed in the firſt year of King <hi>James, An. Dom.</hi> 1604. That all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens, Queſtmen, Sidemen, or Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in every Pariſh ſhall be choſen by the joynt conſent of the Miniſter and the Pariſhioners, if it may be: But if they cannot agree upon ſuch a choyce, then the Miniſter ſhall chooſe one, and the Pariſhioners another; and without ſuch a joynt or ſeveral choyce, none ſhall take upon them to be Churchwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, neither ſhall they continue any longer then one year in that Office, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

                           <p>9. THeſe Officers are diligently to ſee that all the Pariſhioners duly reſort to their Pariſh Church upon all Sundays and Holydays, and there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the whole time of Divine Service, and none to walk or ſtand idle, or talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Church, Church-Yard, or Church-Porch during that time; and all ſuch as ſhall be found ſlack or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in reſorting to the Church (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no great or urgent cauſe of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence) they ſhall earneſtly call upon them, and after due admonition, if the

If the Churchwardens find any perſon abſent from the Church upon Sundays or Holydays, in the time of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, Preaching, or other holy Exerciſe, ſuch perſon is to pay 12 <hi>d.</hi> to the uſe of the Poor; and this extends as well to all Women Covert, as to other perſons: or the Churchwardens, if they pleaſe, may preſent ſuch perſon in the Eccleſiaſtical Court. But note that none are to be puniſhed twice for one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, ſo that they muſt not pay their twelve pence, and be preſented too. 1. <hi>El. Ch. 1.

NOte, that the Law doth make of theſe Officers a kind of a Corporation, <hi>viz.</hi> Perſons enabled by that name to take moveable Goods or Chattels, and to ſue and to be ſued at Law concerning ſuch Goods for the uſe and profit of their Pariſh; for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the Goods of the Church is in them, and they are by that Name ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to take them for the uſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Pariſh: and therefore a man may well in his lifetime, or by his laſt Will, give or grant Mony, or other moveable Goods to the Churchwardens, or Pariſhioners of ſuch a Pariſh, for the Reparations of the Church, or for buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Books, Communion Cups, Linnen Cloths, or other decent Ornaments or furniture for the Church. 12. <hi>H. 7. fo. 27.

                           <p>15. But they cannot take an Eſtate of Lands to them by Name of Churchwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:102982:71"/>
only, for if a Feoffment be made to the uſe of the Churchwardens of <hi>D.</hi> this is avoid uſe, for they have no ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to take ſuch Purchaſe. <hi>Finch. Lib. 2. Ch. 17. pag. 179. Rolls Caſes, 1. Part. fo.</hi> 393.</p>
                           <p>16. Neither can they preſcribe to have Lands to them and their Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; for they are no Corporation to have Lands, but for Goods for the Church only. <hi>P. 37. El. C. B. Longley &amp; Meredines Caſe. Rolls Caſes, 1 Part. fol.</hi> 393.</p>
                           <p>17. If a Man buy a Bell, and hang it up in the Steeple, or make a Pew and ſet it up in the Church, though he make neither words nor writing hereof, yet by this the Bell and Pew are ſo dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Church, that the party that did owe them, can never have them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; for if they ſhould come to remove them, the Churchwardens might ſue them for it. 8. <hi>H. 7. 12. 10.

                           <p>18. They can have no action at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law to recover any Goods of which they never had the poſſeſſion: But if the Churchwardens be once poſſeſſed of any Goods, or Ornaments belonging
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102982:71"/>
to the Church, and afterwards, the ſame things are taken from them, then they have the ſame remedy for the things, as other men have for the goods taken from them: And therefore if ſuch Goods be ſtoln, they may have an Appeal of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, and if they be otherwiſe taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way or abuſed; as if a Bell be broken, or the like,. the Churchwardens may have an Action againſt him that doth it: and in this Action they recover Damages to the uſe of the Pariſh, and not to their own uſe. <hi>Tr. 8.

have no ſuch property in the Goods of their Church, as thereby to have power to give, ſell, releaſe, hurt or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair them, without the aſſent of the Side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or Veſtry. <hi>Vide 38.

                           <p>22. If the Organs be taken out of the Church, the Churchwardens may have an Action of Treſpaſs for the ſame, for the Organs belong to the Pariſhioners, and not to the Parſon; and therefore the Parſon cannot ſue ſuch party in the Eccleſiaſtical Court that took them. <hi>Tr. 12.

                           <p>23. But if the Walls, Windows, or Doors of the Church be broken down, or the Trees in the Churchyard be cut down, or the Graſs thereof be eaten up, the Parſon or Vicar, and not the

The Churchwardens, by the aſſent and agreement of the Pariſhioners, may take a ruinous Bell, and deliver it to a Bell-founder, and agree with him that he ſhall have four pounds for caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and that he ſhall retain the ſame till the four pounds be paid: and ſuch Agreement of the Pariſhioners ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the Churchwardens in a Writ of Account brought againſt them by their Succeſſors Churchwardens. <hi>M. 37, 38.

                           <p>21. IN the putting out of Children Apprentices, there ought to be regard had to the Maſter, the Child and the Parents, Firſt to the Maſter, that he be of ability and honeſty, otherwiſe by ſome device or hard intreaty they may provoke their Apprentices to depart or run away; and regard is alſo to be had to his Trade or Faculty, leſt the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice conſume his time without learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing: Secondly, Regard is to be had to the Apprentices to put them out timely, and while they are young and tractable (ſo that they be above the Age of ſeven years) otherwiſe by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their idle and baſe Educations they will hardly keep their Service, or imploy themſelves to work: Then laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Regard is to be had to the Parents to take away ſuch from them as are brought up to live idlely and looſly, or elſe ſuch

                           <p>23. And theſe Officers are to have the conſent of two Juſtices of the Peace, in the placing out of ſuch Apprentices; and they may bind the Man-child till 24 years of age, and the Woman-child till 21. years of age, or till ſhe be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, which ſhall firſt happen: And theſe Apprentices may be bound to Weavers, Maſons, Dyers, Fullers, or any other Trade, as well as to Husbandry or Houſewifery.

Now this placing of Apprentices may be to any man, whom the Officers and Juſtices think fit to receive them, within the ſame Pariſh, or elſewhere in other Pariſhes within the ſame Hundred either with, or without mony; therefore it is fit in this caſe to conſider, if the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:102982:91"/>
Child be young, and the party to whom they place it not very able, then they may give mony, if they pleaſe, as the party and they ſhall agree. <hi>Reſol. Judges, 1633. Queſt.</hi> 1.</p>
                           <p>25. All men that have, or may have uſe for Servants, as Knights, Clergymen, Gentlemen, and Yeomen, as well as Tradeſmen, are bound to take Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices; yea, though wealthy men Table themſelves, or live ſo privately, that they have no uſe for a Servant, yet they may be compelled to take them; or elſe to pay a ſum of mony for putting them Apprentices elſewhere; and if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to pay the ſum impoſed upon them, Two Juſtices of the Peace may make their Warrant to levy the ſame by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs and ſale of the offenders Goods. <hi>Reſol.

                           <p>27. An Apprentice put to a man in reſpect of his Farm when his Leaſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pireth,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:102982:92"/>
the Apprentice ſhall go ſtill with the Farm, if the firſt Maſter be ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; otherwiſe it is where an Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is put to a man in regard of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, or for other reſpects.

                           <p>28.

                           <p>29. Note, That this binding muſt be by Indenture, and may not well be done by a Verbal Agreement; and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture muſt be either between the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices, Churchwardens and Overſeers, or
<pb facs="tcp:102982:92"/>
them, and the Apprentice on the one part, and him that takes the Apprentice of the other part, as appears by the form of the Indenture in the end of this Chapter; and he muſt be named by the name of Apprentice expreſly, or elſe he is no Apprentice, though he be bound. <hi>Crompt. 184.

                              <p>Several Caſes about the Repairs of Bridges, with the names of the Statutes which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern particular Bridges.</p>
                           </argument>
                           <p>61. WHere a Common Bridge in the Kings High-way is in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, and that it cannot be proved or known, who, nor what Lands are charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the repairing thereof; in this caſe Four Juſtices of the Peace (whereof one to be of the <hi>Quorum</hi>) within the Shire or Riding wherein ſuch decayed Bridges be, and if they be in a City or Town Corporate, then four ſuch Juſtices of Peace there, may, within the limits of their ſeveral Commiſſions, call before them the Conſtables, or two of the moſt honeſt Inhabitants of every Town and Pariſh within the Shire, Riding, City, or Town Corporate, wherein ſuch Bridge or any parcel thereof ſhall happen to be; and the Juſtices (upon the appearance of the Conſtables or other Inhabitants, and with their aſſents) may tax every Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant in any ſuch City, Town, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh within their limits, to ſuch reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:102982:124"/>
ſum of mony as by their diſcretions they ſhall think convenient, aſwell for the repairing of ſuch Bridge, and alſo for the making and repairing of the High-ways by the ſpace of 300 Foot next adjoyning to the ends of any ſuch Bridge. 22. <hi>H. 8.

                           <p>62. But note where the Franchiſe, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or Burrough is a County of it ſelf, and hath not four or more Juſtices of the Peace, whereof one or more are of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> in this caſe no other Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of the Peace of any Shire or County have any power to meddle there by this Act, but ſuch decay muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Common Law by ſuch Remedies, as they were before the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this Statute of 22. <hi>H. 8. Co. 2. Part. Inſt. fo.</hi> 702.</p>
                           <p>63. And note that this Taxation ought not to be made by the Juſtices without the conſent of the Conſtables or Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, nor by them without the Juſtices; and this Tax ought to be upon every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant in particular, and not to be ſet upon the Hundred, Pariſh, Town, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for then one or few might be diſtrained upon for the whole. <hi>Co. 2.

After ſuch Taxation made as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, the ſaid Juſtices of Peace ſhall cauſe the Names and Sums of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon ſo by them Taxed to be written in a Roll indented in Parchment for every Hundred, and ſealed with their Seals. <hi>Co. 2.

                           <p>65. And the ſaid Juſtices may make two Collectors of every Hundred, for the Collecting of all ſuch Sums of Mony, by the ſaid Juſtices ſet and taxed; which Collectors receiving the one part of the Roll indented, have power thereby to collect: all the Sums of Mony therein contained, and if refuſal be made upon demand, then to diſtrain and ſell ſuch diſtreſs, rendring the overplus to the owner if any be, <hi>Dalt.

And the ſaid Collectors and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyors, and their Executors and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrators, &amp; every of them ſhall from time to time make a true Account to the ſaid Juſtices of Peace, of the Receipts, Payments, and Expences of the ſaid Sums of Mony; and if any of them refuſe ſo to do, then the ſaid Juſtices of Peace from time to time by their diſcretions may make out proceſs againſt the ſaid Collectors and Surveyors, their Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Adminiſtrators by Attachment, Precept, or Warrant, under their Hands and Seals returnable at their General Seſſions of the Peace; and the ſaid Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices may allow ſuch reaſonable Coſts and Charges to the ſaid Surveyors and Collectors upon their Account, as to them ſhall ſeem convenient. 22. <hi>H. 8.

                           <p>68. If any ſuch Bridge be wholly in a City, or other Corporate Town, the Inhabitants of the ſaid City or Corporate Town muſt repair it; and where ſuch Bridge lies out of ſuch City or Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Town, the ſame muſt be made by the Inhabitants of the Shire or Riding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in which the ſame Bridge ſhall be; and if part of the Bridge be in one Shire or

                        <p>1. THeſe Treaſurers are certain Officers appointed by the Juſtices of Peace, to have the charge of the Receipt and disburſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mony taxed and levyed upon the whole County, yearly for the relief of poor maimed Souldiers and Mariners; For the Juſtices of Peace are yearly at their Quarter Seſſions, about <hi>Eaſter,</hi> to chooſe or appoint one or two perſons (according to their diſcretions) of the County for the taking and diſtributing of the Monies collected for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes aforeſaid: And theſe Treaſurers, by the words of the Statute; ought to be Subſidie men of 10 pounds in Lands, or 15 pounds in Goods, (but it ſeems, if they be ſufficient men, this is not ſtood upon) and theſe Officers are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue

                        <p>2. Now for the raiſing of Mony for theſe Treaſurers, the greater part of the Juſtices in their Quarter Seſſions have power to charge every Pariſh within their limits towards a weekly Relief of Maimed Souldiers and Mariners, ſo that no Pariſh pay weekly above 10 pence, nor under two pence, nor any County, which conſiſts of above 50 Pariſhes, pay above 6 pence one Pariſh with another, and this is by the 43. <hi>El. Ch.</hi> 3. but it is provided further by the 14. <hi>Car. 2. Ch.</hi> 9. that the Juſtices may tax every Pariſh more than the Rates aboveſaid, ſo as it exceed not two ſhillings and ſix pence, nor be under three pence <hi>per</hi> week. And theſe Sums, thus taxed, muſt be aſſeſſed in every Pariſh by the Pariſhioners (or in their Default) by the Conſtables and Churchwardens (or in their Default) by the next Juſtice or Juſtices of the Peace. 43. <hi>El.

                        <p>3. And the Conſtables and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens have power to levy the Tax in every Pariſh of every perſon refuſing
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:102982:129"/>
to pay the ſame, by Diſtreſs and Sale of his Goods, rendring the overplus to the owner; and in the Conſtables and Churchwardens Default, the next ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning Juſtice may diſtrein for the ſame. 43. <hi>El.

                        <p>4. When the Tax is levyed, the Conſtables and Churchwardens are to deliver it quarterly (ten days before every Quarter Seſſions) to the High Conſtable of their Diviſion, who muſt deliver to the Treaſurers of the County at the ſame Quarter Seſſions all the ſame mony; and if the Conſtables or Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens, their Executors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> fail in the payment to the High Conſtable within the time aforeſaid, then they are to forfeit 20 ſhillings; and if the High Conſtable fail to pay the Treaſurers e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Seſſions, then he forfeits 40 ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; which Forfeitures, as it ſeems, the Treaſurers may levy by Diſtreſs and Sale of the Offenders Goods, without any Warrant, rendring the overplus to to the owner: and theſe Forfeitures are to go in Augmentation of the Treaſurers Stock, 43. <hi>El. Ch.</hi> 3.</p>

                           <pb n="245" facs="tcp:102982:129"/>5. The Maimed Souldier or Mariner which was preſt, ſhall repair (if he be able to Travel) to the Treaſurers of the County where he was preſt; if he were not preſt, then to the Treaſurers of the County where he was born, or where he laſt dwelt by the ſpace of three years, at his Election; but if he be not able to Travel, then to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers of the County where he Lands; and he is to bring with him a Certificate under the Hand and Seal of the Chief Commander, or of the Captain under whom he ſerved, containing the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of his hurts and ſervices, which Certificate ſhall alſo be allowed by the Muſter Maſter, or the Receiver General of the Rolls for the Muſter, under one of their hands. 43 <hi>El.

                        <p>6. Then upon ſuch a Certificate, the Treaſurers aforeſaid may allow the party Relief to maintain him till the next Quarter Seſſions, and then the major part of the Juſtices may allow him a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which the Treaſurers muſt pay him Quarterly, until it ſhall be revoked or altered by the ſaid Juſtices; and this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance is not to exceed 10 pounds <hi>per annum</hi> to a common Souldier, nor 15

But note, where Souldiers and Mariners arrive far from the place where they are to receive Relief, The Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers there ſhall give them Relief, and a Teſtimonial whereby they may paſs from Treaſurer to Treaſurer, until they ſhall come to the place required; And this ſhall be done upon the bare Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate of the Commander and Captain, although they have not as yet obtained any allowance from the Muſter Maſter, or Receiver General of the Muſter Rolls. <hi>Wingate's Stat.
